KNN classification

KNN is supervised ML algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems
The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.
KNN relies on the idea of similarity (sometimes-called distance, proximity, or closeness).

Best K is choosen based on elbow method.
